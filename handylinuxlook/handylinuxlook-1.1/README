Well, this is a little bit special.

 People always represent superheroes with a cape, lazer eyes and strong muscles, ready to help ladys in danger.

 This time the superheroe has only a computer and an idea, create a collective gnu/linux distribution to provide an operating system of high quality for every users "whether they paid to obtain it or not".

 This Artwork is dedicated to the memory of Ian Murdock ( 1973-2015 ) an anonym superheroe, father of the Debian Gnu/linux distribution that help millions people all over the world. thanks to him.
